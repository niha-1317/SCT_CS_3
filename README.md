# SCT_CS_3
I’ve just completed Task 3 of my SkillCraft internship: building a Password Strength Checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This project evaluates the strength of a password based on length, use of numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters — giving users instant feedback to help create stronger and more secure passwords.
